	    <p>At the development level, we take a great deal of time to learn the basics and try to learn the basics 
		    and try to integrate stroke development and other fundamentals into the realm of creativity and 
		    choreography. Stroke development and basic synchro skills (scullling, head checks, pool patterns, 
		    transitinos, and eggbeater) are taught and refined. We also continue with more defined synchro skill 
		    movements (called figures) and routine development. Participation and attendance is very important. 
		    The girls are part of a team so everyone needs to join in the chroeography development and memorization! 
		    Dryland training, is also part of our teachings which consists of strength training, flexibility, 
		    and land drill (this is what we call it when we practice routines on land). Most of all we recognize 
		    the importance of social development with girls this age so encouraging them to do their best and 
		    focus on their strength is a priority in the Development Program! We have the luxury of swimming 
		    at the sam etime as the competitive swimmers so our girls can see what higher leveled swimmers do. 
		    What amazing role models for them! If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to 
		    contract the coaches. <p/>
